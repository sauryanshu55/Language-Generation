# Language-Generation
Reads a sample file and its language patterns, takes number of words to be generated as parameters and generates a text of that number of words in similar linguistic pattern to that of the source file.
You can change the contents of the file in sample.txt and call in (generate-text text-table <param word1> <param word2) in the Racket panel to generate the text.
